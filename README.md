IFakApp
=========

This project has begun as a Proof of Concept for a mobile architecture with mgwt. In the end this mobile architecture has prooven
to be the right choice to work with. This app is for every student at the computer science faculty (IWI) of Hochschule Karlsruhe.
We want to achieve that users want and love to use this app, because of its look and of course its additional benefit for him. 
This app is not just another app full of lists and static information. The user have access to his preffered news feed, the mensa
menus, an access to the common processes of a student life such as registration and observation of its term paper process, his internship,
bachelor or master thesis processes. In future he should be able to get more in touch with his lectures, he can organize his schedule
or to take a part in his own lecture by using the possibilites of realtime feedback. Due to realtime feedback the universit lecturer
can hold an even more adaptive lecture. This means he is able to adapt the pace of his lecture by having an immediate feedback of his
students. On top of this, the user can customize his app. He can pin shortcuts on his home screen (TileBoard) and has access to a
sophisticated setup to customize the app on his needs.
