IFakApp
=========

This project has begun as a Proof of Concept for a mobile architecture with mgwt. In the end this mobile architecture has proven
to be the right choice to work with. This app is for every student at the computer science faculty (IWI) of Hochschule Karlsruhe.
We want to achieve that users want and love to use this app, because of its additional benefit for him of course its look. 
This app is not just another app full of lists and static information. The users have access to their preferred news feed, the mensa
menus, an access to the common processes of a student life such as registration and observation of their term paper process, their internship,
bachelor or master thesis processes. In future they should be able to get more in touch with his lectures, they can organize their schedule
or take part in their own lecture by using the possibilites of realtime feedback. Due to realtime feedback the university lecturer
can hold an even more adaptive lecture. This means he is able to adapt the pace of his lecture by having an immediate feedback of his
students. On top of this, the users can customize their app. They can pin shortcuts on there home screen (TileBoard) and have access to a
sophisticated setup to customize the app according to their needs.
